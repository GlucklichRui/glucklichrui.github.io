I am a PhD student at the math department of [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/), my graduate advisor is [Yiannis Sakellaridis](https://math.jhu.edu/~sakellar/). 


I did my undergraduate study at the math department of [Tsinghua University](https://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), my undergraduate advisor is [Bin Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/binxumath/home).


I am interested about the [relative Langlands duality](https://math.jhu.edu/~sakellar/BZSVpaperV2.pdf), which can be viewed as a combination of gauge field theory and Lie group theory in the field of autormophic representation theory. 


I benefit a lot from the online [automorphic project seminar](https://researchseminars.org/seminar/AutomorphicProject) and [atlas seminar](https://researchseminars.org/seminar/atlas).


The following quote from [Zhuangzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)) describes my feeling between the distinction over number fields and function fields:
"Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the Transformation of Things."
