I am a PhD student at the math department of [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/), my advisor is [Yiannis Sakellaridis](https://math.jhu.edu/~sakellar/). 


I did my undergraduate study at the math department of [Tsinghua University](https://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), my undergraduate advisor is [Bin Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/binxumath/home).


I am interested about the relative Langlands program, Arthur endoscopic classification of automorphic representations. 


I learned a lot from the online [automorphic project seminar](https://researchseminars.org/seminar/AutomorphicProject) and [atlas seminar](https://researchseminars.org/seminar/atlas).
