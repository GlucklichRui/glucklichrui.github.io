I am a PhD student at the math department of [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/), my graduate advisor is [Yiannis Sakellaridis](https://math.jhu.edu/~sakellar/). 


I did my undergraduate study at the math department of [Tsinghua University](https://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), my undergraduate advisor is [Bin Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/binxumath/home).


I am interested about the [relative Langlands duality](https://math.jhu.edu/~sakellar/BZSVpaperV2.pdf), which is an arithmetic analog of the electric-magnetic duality of boundary
conditions in four-dimensional supersymmetric Yangâ€“Mills theory.


I benefit a lot from the online [automorphic project seminar](https://researchseminars.org/seminar/AutomorphicProject) and [atlas seminar](https://researchseminars.org/seminar/atlas).
