This is the first of the two talks about perverse sheaves with Rui. Perverse sheaves are powerful tools for understanding the topologies of algebraic varieties. Some of their influential appearances that I am aware of (which I don't know enough to say more, so I will put in the abstract for advertising purpose): Weil's conjectures, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, Kazhdan-Lusztig conjectures, Hodge theory. For the first talk, I will describe six-functor formalisms in the derived category of constructible sheaves, define perverse sheaves as an abelian subcategory of the former, and provide some examples of perverse sheaves.
